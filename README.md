##Problem

Account managers spend their week in back-to-back meetings—relaying project insights from clients to their team and back again. With so many projects, emails, and tasks to oversee, account managers are burdened with endless information. Getting the right information to the right people requires substantial time and energy.  

##Mission & Vision

Kanto makes client project information accessible, insightful, and actionable in order to build healthy, effective workplace cultures and relationships. 

##Solution

Kanto is a cloud-based web application for account managers at consulting agencies to document, organize, and assign client project information. Kanto will act as a ‘knowledge base’ for account managers to update and reference as they make progress on multiple projects.

Documentation: Account managers will take notes in Kanto with Kanto’s proprietary note-taking methodology. In meetings, account managers can easily record important information in the right place by quick-toggling between project sections.

Organization: Kanto enables account managers to organize notes by project, project sections, and note type. Projects are composed of project sections, which are containers that group similar information (i.e.: funding, design, development, standards). Note types help account managers separate project information from project tasks (i.e.: note, task, question). Lastly, notes are organized and labeled with a timestamp.

Delegation: With all project notes in one place, delegation becomes simple. Account managers can export relevant project notes by project section, note type, or timestamp in order to get the right information to the right team members. 

##Customer/User Archetype

Client-facing managers who struggle with information overload from multiple client projects.
